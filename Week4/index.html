  <p> <class="allParagraphStyle"> Everyday I review many, many resumes.  Resumes come in all sorts of formats from basic formatting to Picasso-esk works of art.
  </p>

  <span>Surprisingly, the more simple, the better.</span>
     <p>One of the main reasons is because of the "Applicant Tracking System" (ATS).   An ATS is computer software system that accesses resume, filters for key words, and parses resume info in order to sort through resumes before a human puts an eye on it. The ATS identifies the key words and picks resumes that have the most key words that align with the job posting.</p>
     <p>
      As beautiful and creative that your resume can be, it is the content, and the ease of extracting that content, that holds supreme value.

    <h2>To Dos</h2>


  <ol>
<li>Search for example resumes online e.g., "Barber Resumes"</li>
<li>Search for "Barber" job postings. Look at as many as you can.</li>
<li>Print out, or save and highlite, or write down the key words in the job postings. In other words, the experience needed, the years, the education level, etc.,</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Taylor your resume to each job individually.  ATS nor recruiters will take time to bridge the links or close the gaps.</li>
<li>Pay attention to "must have requirements"</li>
  <li>Stay consistent in tense "Worked" or "Working" - use the 'ed' or the 'ing' throughout and try not to switch tense</li>
<li>Never copy job posting descriptions and use them as the experience in your resume.  Recruiters can see right through it.</li>
